The main reason I choose to embark on this journey is because I was tired of being stuck in my ordainary routine. I wanted to make a drastic change in my everyday life. When I graduated HS in 2015, I choose to take a year off before going to college. My year off is rounding 5 years this upcoming july. My birthday passed Nov 13 and I turned 23 years old. Around septemeber I realized that I couldnt bring in another year without doing something to futher my education. I orriginally was gonna start my college education for business and administration but after doing some research online I came across Flatiron. Software Engineering is something that never has crossed my mind as far as me doing that as a career. I knew it was something that was gonna be a challenge but something that would pay off big time in the long run. I just think its something great to know that will set me more valuable than the next person.
